This result was partly offset by lower business volumes in the Life/Health business segment, primarily due to softer single -premium volumes, and \\na decrease in AuM -driven revenues in our Asset Management business segment.  \\n Internal growth, which adjusts for foreign currency translation and consolidation effects, was strong at 3.5 percent, driven by the Property -Casualty business segment.  \\n  \\nEarnings  \\n 1Q 2023: Operating profit jumped 24.2 percent to 3.7 (1Q 2022: 3.0) billion euros. This is due to a higher result of our US operations in the Life/Health business segment, and a stronger insura nce service result in \\nthe Property -Casualty business segment. This was partly offset by the Asset Management business segment \\ndue to reduced AuM -driven revenues and a higher cost -income ratio.  \\n Shareholders’ core net income was strong at 2.2 (1Q 2022: 0.4 ) billion euros due to both a higher operating \\nprofit and an improved non -operating result. Non -operating result in the prior year was impacted by a \\nprovision related to the AllianzGI US Structured Alpha matter.  \\n \\nNet income attributable to shareholders was  2.0 (1Q 2022: 0.5) billion euros, up substantially in part due to \\nthe aforementioned provision.  \\n \\nCore Earnings per Share (EPS)\\n3 was 5.43 (1Q 2022: 1.02) euros.  \\n The annualized Core Return on Equity (RoE)\\n3 was 15.6 percent (full year 2022: 12.7 percent).  \\n \\n \\n3 EPS and RoE calculation based on shareholder‘s core net income  ', metadata={'source': 'documents/quarterly_earnings/en-allianz-ir-release-1Q-2023.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Page 3 of 7  On May 10, 2023, Allianz has announced a new share buy- back program of up to 1.5 billion euros.

With the first- time application of IFRS 9 and 17, we delivered our results with even more clarity and \\ntransparency and proved our ability to create value.  \\n• Our Property -Casualty business showed excellent internal growth, driven by healthy pricing that \\ncontributed to  offset the impact of inflation. The significant increase in operating profit is due to our \\nstrict underwriting discipline and focus on productivity gains.  \\n• Value creation in our Life/Health business is strong. Our profitability is well supported by the sol idity \\nof our in -force business as well as the robustness of new business value.  \\n• Our active Asset Management recorded 14.9 billion euros net inflows and our third -party assets \\nunder management reached 1.7 trillion euros.

Adjusted for foreign currency translation and consolidation effects, internal growth was strong at 11.1 percent due to a volume effect of 5.0 percent, a price effect of 5.6 percent as well as a service effect of 0.5 percent. The main \\ncontributors to the increase were AGCS, Türkiye, Allianz Partners and Germany.  \\n \\nOperating profit surged by 22.7 percent to 1.9 (1.5) billion euros, due to a higher operating insurance service result that was partly offset by a slightly lower operating investment result.  \\n The combined ratio improved by 1.9 percentage points to 91.9 percent (93.8 percent).

Also, we worked hard to achieve fair settlements with investors in the \\nStructured Alpha funds in the U.S. and move toward a final resolution.”  \\n- Oliver Bäte, Chief Executive Officer of Allianz SE  \\n \\n \\n \\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS  \\n \\nRevenues  \\n \\n1Q 2022: Total revenues rose by 6.2 percent to 44.0 billion euros. The Property -Casualty business segment \\nbenefited from higher prices and volumes while the Asset Management business recorded higher assets under \\nmanagement -driven revenues. Increased sales in the United States and Germany contributed to revenue \\ngrowth in the Life/Health business segment.  \\n \\nInternal revenue growth, which adjusts for foreign currency translation and consolidation effects, increased \\nto a strong 3.8 percent, driven by all busine ss segments.  \\n \\n \\nEarnings  \\n \\n1Q 2022: Operating profit 3.2 (1Q 2021: 3.3) billion euros, down 2.9 percent as claims from natural \\ncatastrophes nearly quadrupled, leading to a decline in the underwriting result in the Property -Casualty \\nbusiness segment. This was  partly offset by a strong operating result in the Asset Management business \\nsegment due to higher average third -party assets under management (AuM). In the Life/Health business \\nsegment, operating profit remained stable.  \\n \\nNet income attributable to shareh olders was 0.6 billion euros, down 78.1 percent. The decline reflects the \\nimpact of an additional pre -tax provision of 1.9 billion euros related to the AllianzGI U.S. Structured Alpha \\nproceedings, which reduced the group’s first -quarter net income by 1.6 b illion euros.  \\n \\nAnnualized Return on Equity (RoE) was 3.5 percent (full year 2021: 10.6 percent).  \\n \\nBasic Earnings per Share (EPS) was 1.38 (6.23) euros, down 77.9 percent.  \\n \\n \\nSolvency II Capitalization Ratio  \\n \\nThe Solvency II capitalization ratio was 199 pe rcent at the end of 1Q 2022 compared with 209 percent at the \\nend of 4Q 2021. Including the application of transitional measures for technical provisions, the Solvency II \\ncapitalization ratio was 226 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2022 compared with 239 percent at the \\nend of 2021.

We have achieved nearly a fourth of our full -year \\ntarget, which shows our operating perf ormance remains on track.   \\n• In our Property -Casualty business, we witnessed strong internal growth, driven by healthy pricing and \\nrobust volume growth as our business benefits from its solid position in a recovering economy. Our \\noperating profit was affect ed by the highest level of claims from natural catastrophes for a first -\\nquarter in a decade.  \\n• In Life/Health, the strong improvement in our new business margin and value reflects an improved \\nbusiness mix and increase in volumes across most entities. This b odes very well for our future \\nprofitability.  \\n• Our Asset Management business had a very strong first -quarter in terms of operating profit. The net \\nincome of the segment was impacted by a provision related to the Structured Alpha matter to address \\nthe remain ing financial exposure in relation to compensation payments to investors and any \\nresolution of governmental proceedings. The provision will not affect our dividend policy and payout.  \\nWe confirm our full -year outlook of operating profit of 13.4 billion euro s,  plus or minus 1 billion euros.”  \\n- Giulio Terzariol, Chief Financial Officer of Allianz SE  \\n \\n \\nProperty -Casualty insurance: Good underlying result  \\n \\n1Q 2022: Total revenues rose by 9.1 percent to 21.5 (19.7) billion euros. Adjusted for foreign currency \\ntranslation and consolidation effects, internal growth was strong at 6.6 percent due to a price effect of 4.1 \\npercent, a volume effect of 2.0 percent as well as a service effect of 0.4 percent. This increase reflected a \\nhealthy growth across entities and geog raphies.  \\n \\nOperating profit was 1.4 (1.5) billion euros, down by 9.0 percent from the year -earlier period due to a lower \\nunderwriting result, which was affected by considerably higher claims from natural catastrophes and to a \\nlower extent by attritional los ses. A favorable contribution from run -off result had a partially offsetting effect. \\nThe expense ratio increased slightly to 27.1 percent (27.0 percent) due to higher acquisition costs mainly from \\na change in business mix at Allianz Partners.  \\n \\nThe combined ratio rose by 1.7 percentage points to 94.7 percent (93.0 percent). While the combined ratio in \\nour retail business3 increased, mostly due to the impact of higher natural catastrophes and the \\nnormalization of motor claims frequency, it improved si gnificantly in our commercial business3. \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                \\n3 Our retail business compromises retail, small - and medium -sized enterprises (SME) and fleet while our commercial business \\ncontains MidCorp and large  business.
